# Parareal-algorithm

## Project description 
This repository deals with implements parareal algorithm for the underdamped Langevin equation where the coarse an fine integrators correspond to different force fields. This code was used to produce the results in [An Adaptive Parareal Algorithm: Application to the Simulation of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/21M1412979).
